    Introduction to programming and computer science. This course exposes
    students to techniques of abstraction at several levels: (a) within a
    programming language, using higher-order functions, manifest types,
    data-directed programming, and message-passing; (b) between programming
    languages, using functional and rule-based languages as examples. It also
    relates these techniques to the practical problems of implementation of
    languages and algorithms on a von Neumann machine. There are several
    significant programming projects.
