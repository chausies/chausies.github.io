        <h1>Make our systems sophisticated</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Ajay Tripathi. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in
          Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2015. Now, I
          pursue my PhD at Stanford University in EE. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very lucky, because the world is so richly pervasive with
          obvious problems. Traffic control is atrocious, and so many
          systems are inefficient, inconvenient, and outright stupid. So
          much of our society is desperately in need of even a shred of
          machine learning or optimization. For example, wait times at the
          Berkeley Post Office are consistently upwards of 50 minutes, and
          all they give you is a waiting number. Too scared to miss your
          turn, you stay put in the post office. Ridiculous. If there's 15
          people ahead of you, why can't you be given a 95% confidence
          interval on how long your wait time will be? Then you'll know
          that you have at least 40 minutes to get Starbucks without
          missing your turn. It's such a simple convenience to offer
          customers, and all you need to do is monitor service times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, education, healthcare, the judiciary, and so many more
          parts of society are rife with inefficiencies because no one has
          the sense to apply any AI to them. I want this to change, and it
          is my wish to penetrate into society at large with the
          exceptionally potent tools in optimization, control, stochastic
          analysis, and machine learning. It is also my wish to develop and
          expand these tools even further to make them all the more
          powerful and capable for tackling such an unimaginably data-rich
          world.
        <p>
          My research interests are
          <ul>
            <li>Stochastic and Random Processes</li>
            <li>Optimization</li>
            <li>Signal Processing</li>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Control Theory</li>
            <li>Psychometrics</li>
            <li>Information Theory</li>
          </ul>
